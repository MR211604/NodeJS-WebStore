# NodeJS-Webstore
NodeJS webstore using Firebase (Email, Google, Github, Facebook authentication) and JWT. Currently an experimental personal project for researching new technologies to learn/implement.

Rememeber to change and import (if you have a separate file for it like i do) ```firebaseConfig``` using your own firebase configuration settings like so: 

```
import {firebaseConfig} from '.../firebaseConfig.js'
```
